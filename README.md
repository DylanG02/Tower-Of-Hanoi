# Tower-Of-Hanoi

A web application that uses the stack data structure to create a functioning Tower of Hanoi game with draggable tiles.

## Description:

This was a pair progarmming project in which me and my freind worked together to create one of my faveourtie projects so far. After learning about data structures at the very end of codecademy's front end developer career path we had the idea to incorperate stack's into a project and Tower of Hanoi was what we came up with!

## Features:

  -Draggable tiles to create a fun and intuative game
  -Uses stack logic for each pole to allow the game to run with ease
  -Includes a level selector feature allowing you to adjust difficulty 
  -Uses javascript array methods 
  -Using object oriantated programming to creeate easy modular code
  
## Improvements:

One thing we are planning on adding is the algorythm to solve the tower of hanoi for you depending on the level. Overall I am really happy with this project as it it combines pair programming as well as almost everything we learned in the fron end web career path on Codecademy.
